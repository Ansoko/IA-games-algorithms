# Multiples IA algorithms implemeted in games

<b>Boids</b> :<br>
You are the zombies' god and they obey to you to the finger and the eye... well, almost.<br>
With your goddest main, gather zombies and lead them to humans to eat them. Watch out, humans are armed and don't hesitate to shoot your followers if they are too close to them!<br>
Move your hand with the mouse.<br>
If all the humans became zombie you won, but if all the zombies have died you have lost!

<br>
<b>Genetic algorithm :</b><br>
The problem solved by this algo is the following :
Two humans raise boars for living. Those boar reproduce every x days.
Every day, the human has a choice : not eating, or kill a boar to eat. If the doesn't eat for a certain amout of time, they die. If there is not enought boars, he cannot eat that day, and also die.
<br>The goal for the humans are to survive as long as possible.
